# EP_CshtmlToHtmlAndCss
###### The initials EP in any repository stand for Educational Project. These are course projects and personal experiments for learning. 
A long time ago I was asked to complete an academic exercise with HTML and CSS, I wanted to do it with ASP but in order not to get out of the requirement I also made a translator that translated the front end of my ASP project to HTML and CSS.
That's why I made a small additional program that translates the ASP project to just a few HTML and CSS files.

You can run the translator to test the translation and see the clean HTML and CSS generated.

The code of the translator is in the folder translator-project
ASP project code is in the asp-project folder

The translator code is commented!
